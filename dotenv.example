# IF you are trying to run this code on a LAMP-stack-equipped machine,
# copy this file to .env (with the dot!) and then edit it to change
# your settings.
#
# NOTE: Any edits you make to this file, or to an .env file which you
# copied from this, won't appear in production. The deployment scripts
# know nothing about this file. You need to edit the
# ansible/secrets.yml file, and/or the template at
# ansible/roles/site-deployed/templates/dotenv.j2.
#
# NOTE: If you are running Vagrant, ignore this file completely. Edit
# the Vagrant-generated .env file, or the Ansible files mentioned in
# the previous paragraph, instead.


### Temporary directories; all must be Apache-writable.

PTRON_TMPDIR="tmp"

# Used for sessions. Default location is bad because all PHP
# scripts running on the same server will clean up sessions
# with the default session lifetimes, rather than the one
# specified below.
#
# Also used for KRB5CCNAME when managing moira lists.
PTRON_SESSION_CACHE_DIR="tmp"

# Path for cached HTMLPurifier data
PTRON_HTMLPURIFIER_CACHE_PATH="tmp/purifier-cache"


### Paths for local file storage

# Path for user pictures; must be Apache-writable
#
# The PTRON_PICPATH needs some fixing; it currently serves as:
#  - part of the path for local picture files
#  - part of the URL for picture downloads
#  - part of the object name and URL for Amazon S3 uploads of pictures
PTRON_PICPATH="uploads/pictures/"
